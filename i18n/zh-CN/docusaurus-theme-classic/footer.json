Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>\n          </div>\n          <div style=\"border-top: 1px solid #ccc;min-height: 60px;line-height: 20px;text-align: center;font-family: Avenir-Medium;font-size: 14px;color: #999;display: flex;align-items: center;\"><span>Copyright Â© 2019-2020 The Apache Software Foundation.
